Keep previous state as part of even transition, but deltas are the truth (previous state is a cache, it's computable from previous event stream)

Auditablility

Replayability ("fix and replay")

Temporal Queries

Retroactive events

Internal versus external events

Events come from the business domain, not the implementation



Event store as a functional database

Use verbs in the past tense, not commands

"append-only architectures distribute more easily than updating architectures because there are far fewer locks to deal with."
-- Geteventstore

Scale by partitioning (functional [e.g. geographic] or replication [sharding])

Impedance mismatch [between Object and Relational, between Event and Object]
(set based thinking versus subtype based thinking)

"Current State is a left fold of previous facts. ... an Event Store is actually a functional database."
-- Geteventstore


"events should describe business intent"
-- Microsoft

Events are immutable. Immutable + Append only allows performance

Debugging - replay events to observe problems

"Implementing a message-driven system is far from simple"
-- Microsoft

Difference between events and transactions
"events capture intent in addition to recording the facts of what happened"
-- Microsoft

Concurrency you can either allow multiple updates for the same state (best if possible), or timestamps, or serialise the state and use state ids.

Materialised views

JSON vs XML
protobuffers or capnproto or gob
snapshots

Side effects on replay (Separate side-effect and state change, only do side-effect on state save, pub/sub for side effects)
Reporting (and other queries - materialised view "read model", pub/sub)
Concurrent writes (eventual consistency, but define your needs)

What do you do when event meaning changes in the domain?
Update your event handler
Don't rewrite events. [immutable]
Possibly version your events - new "semantics" are actually a new kind of event

Validation
Execution
Client events
Domain events

Events as they come from the client
XML/SOAP
JSON

Translate to internal client event representation
Text -> map[string]interface{}
Text -> client event struct
Custom JSON serializers
timestamps or serial numbers?
trace ids
validation

Translate that to internal domain event representation
copy map -> struct with transformation
copy event -> event with transformation
transform event in place
add UUIDs for created objects?
don't store passwords, salt and hash them
be careful about logging

Store events
Append only
Immutable
Flat text files!
Geteventstore
Redis
NoSQL (Mongo)
SQL (Postgres)

Injection attacks
Just because you don't have SQL doesn't mean you can't get injection

Handle events
Send domain events to the vent processor
Process in one place, or process per-event

Replay on startup
process from event store using same event handler. simple!
Idempotence - side effect on store
This is why your create events need object ids

Use channels for sharing
most events are asynchronous
get is synchronous, use a channel for reply
